# Awesome Linear Algebra [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

:books: A list of books, courses, libraries, PDFs, tutorials, etc. for students
and learners of Linear Algebra.

Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear relationships
through the representation of linear equations, vectors, and matrices. It is
typically taught as a distinct subject or course in higher education, although
most high school curriculums today include parts of its theory and concepts. Its
applications are found in computer science, economics, cryptology, data science,
computer graphics, physics, artificial intelligence, social sciences,
engineering, etc.

The goal of this list is to include the best & up-to-date resources of all kinds
that can be helpful to anyone learning or studying Linear Algebra. It also links
to resources particularly useful for developers who find the subject to be a
part of their projects and students studying Linear Algebra by means of computer
programming.
